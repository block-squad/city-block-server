## About
[cityBLOCK](http://city-block.herokuapp.com/#/) is a crowdfunding application that utilizes blockchain technology and smart contracts to support urban development projects. Using smart contracts (virtual agreements encoded and held in the blockchain), community members can create and contribute Ether (cryptocurrency) to urban development projects. If the funding target amount is raised by the deadline, the city is held responsible for carrying out the project.
